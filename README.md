## Advent of Code

This repo documents my overall attempts at the incredibly wonderful Eric Wastl's
Advent of Code years. Links to individual repos of code, are in the colourful
table below.

I started in 2022, so I'm gradually back-filling earlier years as and when I
have time.

The rules I obey by, in brief, are:

* No help from anyone/anywhere
* No AI, of any kind
* Allowed to do non-AoC research

### Progress

_2024-12-11: I'm currently doing 2024 "live", but when I have spare time and
inclination, working through 2021._

**Key:**  
ğŸŸ¨ - 2 stars  
ğŸŸ§ - 1 star (so far...)  
â¬œ - 0 stars because I'm probably a bit behind or still working through this year  
ğŸŸ¦ - still to be revealed!  
â¬› - haven't really worked on this year, yet

Squares go from Day 1 on the left to Day 25 on the right.

### Notes

I occasionally do some earlier puzzles from old years, as part of my coaching
work - these are more for demos than me actually "getting into" a year,
properly.
