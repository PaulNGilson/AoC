## Advent of Code

This repo documents my overall attempts at the incredibly wonderful Eric Wastl's
Advent of Code years. Links to individual repos of code, are in the colourful
table below.

I started in 2022, so I'm gradually back-filling earlier years as and when I
have time.

The rules I obey by, in brief, are:

* No help from anyone/anywhere
* No AI, of any kind
* Allowed to do non-AoC research

### Progress

_2024-12-25: I've just finished doing 2024 "live", but when I have spare time
and inclination, I'm working through 2021._

**Key:**  
ğŸŸ¨ - 2 stars  
ğŸŸ§ - 1 star (so far...)  
â¬œ - 0 stars because I'm probably a bit behind or still working through this year  
ğŸŸ¦ - still to be revealed!  
â¬› - haven't really worked on this year, yet

Squares go from Day 1 on the left to Day 25 on the right.

### Notes

I occasionally do some earlier puzzles from old years, as part of my coaching
work - these are more for demos than me actually "getting into" a year,
properly.

### Noteworthy Days

I'll avoid spoilers in this section, but wanted - for my own notes - to pick out
particular highlights (and lowlights!) from various challenges.

#### 2024

* Day 12 - part 2's solution of pairs of pairs felt elegant and seems to be an
  unusual route to solving this one.
* Day 16 - part 2 essentially involved changing `<` to `<=` which made me laugh.
  Usually, my self-invented approaches are slow and unhelpful, so this made for
  a nice change. I included both the initial part 1 solution, and eventual
  part1+2 solution in the repo for comparison.

#### 2023

* Day 12 - part 2 gave me actual sleep problems, as I just couldn't think up an
  approach that ended up being quick enough - everything was O(years) to
  complete. Must've taken me >10 days and I think I built 8-12 different
  solutions. Fine line between perseverance and bloody-mindedness in refusing to
  go looking for any help. Still no idea what a "good" approach is, but I
  haven't felt able to return to it after finally solving it.

#### 2021

* Day 21 - part 2, I just read through and then didn't have time to do for a few
  days, but settled on what I thought was a really clean approach, and was
  amazed to not only code it as desired without errors but it gave the right
  answer to the test data first time. Noteworthy, because I had lots of ideas
  but didn't half-implement things - that time to mull it over really worked for
  me, on something I initially felt would be very difficult. I usually write
  multiple different solutions as I think them up, and find they don't work
  efficiently enough.
